               Hi, I'm Brian Anderson. Read information and perspectives about  birding in Essex. This blog is a diary of my trips around the country chasing birds. Enjoyed every place I visit, caught the cherishing moments of birds in my photographs, and also met different people along the way, and through every article, <br/>that entire experience is expressed.
